## Contributions :heart: <3

- Thanks to ahmedi92 and goko for the contributions on this version. You rock!

## Announcements

- SDK: the SDK will be extracted to a separate package in the version major version (4.0.0)
- CLI: the CLI will be extracted to a separate package in the future major version (4.0.0)
- We <3 contributions!
- We are working on the legal framework to let outside (non-Siemens) collaborators contribute. Stay tuned :)

## About the SDK in the project and what to expect

The SDK in this package is only a **preliminary version** which is used to provide support for the CLI.

Even though you can already play with it, don't rely on it too much because it will be redesigned in the future to support
different scenarios like deployment in the browser and also different authentication mechanisms like frontend authentication,
backend authentication and token service authentication (for cross tenant access) in the SDK.

This is at the moment really just a pre-pre-alpha version which was necessary in order to be able to provide the CLI commands and it only
works with service credentials authentication.

## Bulk Imports and Standard Imports

At this point in time (May 2019) the Bulk Import only works for Simulation Assets and not for Performance Assets. This is why in this version
we still use the standard APIs for the import of the historical data. Please be aware that the use of this feature has a direct impact
on *your* MindSphere resource consumption and that you might get a notice that you will need to upgrade your account's data ingest rate.

The standard import feature will be deprecated and removed from the CLI once bulk upload also gets enabled for performance assets.
