## Full documentation

The full documentation can be found at [https://opensource.mindsphere.io/docs/mindconnect-nodejs/index.html](https://opensource.mindsphere.io/docs/mindconnect-nodejs/index.html)

## Installing the library

There are several ways to install the library. The most common one is via npm registry:

```bash
# install the latest stable library from the npm registry
npm install @mindconnect/mindconnect-nodejs --save
# install the latest alpha library from the npm registry
npm install @mindconnect/mindconnect-nodejs@alpha --save
```

## Getting started

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/cli-documentation-%23009999.svg)](https://opensource.mindsphere.io/docs/mindconnect-nodejs/cli/index.html)

The easiest way to start is to use the provided command line interface to create a starter project:

```bash
# for typescript nodejs project run
npx @mindconnect/mindconnect-nodejs starter-ts

# for javascript nodejs project run
npx @mindconnect/mindconnect-nodejs starter-js
```

## How to create a nodejs MindSphere agent

The following steps describe the easiest way to test the library. You can of course create the required dependencies also programmatically via API calls.

### Step 0: Create an asset type and aspect types

MindSphere V3 IoT model requires that you create an asset type and aspect types to describe your assets. For the example we will create an asset type of type Engine with two aspect types: Environment and Vibration. (Note that my tenant is called castidev, you will have to use your own tenant name)

![assetype](images/types.png)

More information about [MindSphere Data Model](https://siemens.mindsphere.io/en/docs/tutorials/asset-manager).

### Step 1: Create an asset

Create an asset (In example it is called **AcmeMotor**) of type Engine in AssetManager for your data.

### Step 2: Create an agent of type MindConnectLib in MindSphere

Create an agent in Asset Manager of type core.MindConnectLib create initial JSON token and store it to file (e.g. agentconfig.json)

```json
{
    "content": {
        "baseUrl": "https://southgate.eu1.mindsphere.io",
        "iat": "<yourtokenishere>",
        "clientCredentialProfile": [
            "SHARED_SECRET"
        ],
        "clientId": "a3ac5ae889544717b02fa8282a30d1b4",
        "tenant": "<yourtenantishere>"
    },
    "expiration": "2018-04-06T00:47:39.000Z"
}
```

### Step 3 : Create an agent

Read the initial configuration from the config file and create the agent.
If you are using the **SHARED_SECRET** profile there is no need to setup the local certificate for the communication (recommended for smaller devices).

```typescript
    const configuration = require("../../agentconfig.json");
    const agent = new MindConnectAgent(configuration);
```

 If you want to use the **RSA_3072** profile you must also set up the agent certificate.

```typescript
// you can create the private.key for example using openssl:
// openssl genrsa -out private.key 3072

agent.SetupAgentCertificate(fs.readFileSync("private.key"));
```

### Step 4: Onboard the agent

The first operation is onboarding of the agent. This creates a client secret which is used for the communication with MindSphere.

This data is stored by default in the .mc folder in your application if you don't change the base path in the constructor of the agent.

**Important**: Make sure that your folder with the configurations is not reachable from the internet as it contains the client_secret for the authentication.

```typescript
if (!agent.IsOnBoarded()) {
    await agent.OnBoard();
}
```

### Step 5: Configure the data model and data mappings to asset variables. (via code)

**Important**: From the version 3.8.0 it is possible to create the data source configuration and data mappings fully automatic via code

First you need to create a data source configuration

```typescript
// create data source configuration for an asset type castidev.Engine
const generatedConfig = await agent.GenerateDataSourceConfiguration(`${agent.GetTenant()}.Engine`);
await agent.PutDataSourceConfiguration(generatedConfig);
```

and then the data mappings:

```typescript
const mappings = await agent.GenerateMappings(targetAssetId);
await agent.PutDataMappings(mappings);
```

The agents have now access to MindSphere TypeScript SDK (in beta)

```typescript
agent.Sdk();
// the sdk gives you access to e.g. asset management client with which you can get asset types or assets from mindsphere
// which can be used for automatic data source configuration and automatic mappings

const assetMgmt = agent.Sdk().GetAssetManagementClient();
await assetMgmt.GetAssets(...);
await assetMgmt.GetAspectTypes(...);

```

If you take a look at the MindSphere configuration of your agent now it should look like this:

![datasources](images/datasources.png)

And the data mappings should be in place

![mappings](images/mappings.png)

### Step 6 After this you can send the data in the code

```typescript
for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {

    const values: DataPointValue[] = [
        { "dataPointId": "DP-Temperature", "qualityCode": "0", "value": (Math.sin(index) * (20 + index % 2) + 25).toString() },
        { "dataPointId": "DP-Pressure", "qualityCode": "0", "value": (Math.cos(index) * (20 + index % 25) + 25).toString() },
        { "dataPointId": "DP-Humidity", "qualityCode": "0", "value": ((index + 30) % 100).toString() },
        { "dataPointId": "DP-Acceleration", "qualityCode": "0", "value": (1000.0 + index).toString() },
        { "dataPointId": "DP-Frequency", "qualityCode": "0", "value": (60.0 + (index * 0.1)).toString() },
        { "dataPointId": "DP-Displacement", "qualityCode": "0", "value": (index % 10).toString() },
        { "dataPointId": "DP-Velocity", "qualityCode": "0", "value": (50.0 + index).toString() }
    ];

    // there is an optional timestamp parameter if you need to use something else instead of Date.now()
    const result = await agent.PostData(values);
}
```

(If you were using UI to configure data mappings you will have long integers instead of human-readable data point Ids.)

### Step 6.1 using bulk upload

If you don't want to send the data points one by one, you can also use the BulkPostData method

```typescript
const bulk: TimeStampedDataPoint[] =
    [{
        "timestamp": "2018-08-23T18:38:02.135Z",
        "values":
            [{ "dataPointId": "DP-Temperature", "qualityCode": "0", "value": "10" },
            { "dataPointId": "DP-Pressure", "qualityCode": "0", "value": "10" }]
    },
    {
        "timestamp": "2018-08-23T19:38:02.135Z",
        "values": [{ "dataPointId": "DP-Temperature", "qualityCode": "0", "value": "10" },
        { "dataPointId": "DP-Pressure", "qualityCode": "0", "value": "10" }]
    }];

await agent.BulkPostData (bulk);
```

## Events

Events can now be created with the library. You can create events for your agent or for your entities. In order to create an event for your entity you need to know the assetId of the asset.

```javascript
const configuration = require("../../agentconfig.json");
const agent = new MindConnectAgent(configuration);

if (!agent.IsOnBoarded()) {
    await agent.OnBoard();
}

const event: MindsphereStandardEvent = {
    "entityId": configuration.content.clientId, // use assetid if you dont want to store event in the agent :)
    "sourceType": "Event",
    "sourceId": "application",
    "source": "Meowz",
    "severity": 20, // 0-99 : 20:error, 30:warning, 40: information
    "timestamp": new Date().toISOString(),
    "description": "Test"
};

// send event with current timestamp
await agent.PostEvent(event);
```

![events](images/events.png)

## File Upload

Files can now be uploaded via the library. You can upload files for your agent or for your entities. In order to create an event for your entity you need to know the assetid of the asset.

Since version 3.5.1. the agents are using the multipart upload API of the MindSphere. This means that the agents can upload files also bigger > 8 MB, The
multipart upload must be switched on (chunk:true) if you want to activate this behavior. The parameter parallelUploads determine the maximal number of parallel uploads. You can increase this on a powerful computer to speed up the upload or decrease to prevent network congestion.

```javascript
const configuration = require("../../agentconfig.json");
const agent = new MindConnectAgent(configuration);

if (!agent.IsOnBoarded()) {
    await agent.OnBoard();
}


await agent.UploadFile(agent.ClientId(), "custom/mindsphere/path/package.json", "package.json", {
    retry: RETRYTIMES,
    description: "File uploaded with MindConnect-NodeJS Library",
    parallelUploads: 5,
    chunk: true
});
```

![files](images/files.png)

## Full Agent

Here is a demo agent implementation.

[![mindsphere-agent](https://img.shields.io/badge/mindsphere-agent-green.svg)](src/demoagent/test-agent.ts)

## Making sure that the data arrives also with flaky internet connection

You can wrap all asynchronous object calls into the retry function which will automatically retry the operation for n times before throwing an exception.

```typescript
import { MindConnectAgent, MindsphereStandardEvent, retry, TimeStampedDataPoint } from "@mindconnect/mindconnect-nodejs";

// if you want to be more resillient you can wrap every async method
// in the retry function which will try to retry several times before throwing an exception

// onboarding over flaky connection
await retry (5, ()=>agent.OnBoard())

// bulk upload with 5 retries
const bulk: TimeStampedDataPoint[] =
[{
    "timestamp": "2018-08-23T18:38:02.135Z",
    "values":
        [{ "dataPointId": "DP-Temperature", "qualityCode": "0", "value": "10" },
        { "dataPointId": "DP-Pressure", "qualityCode": "0", "value": "10" }]
},
{
    "timestamp": "2018-08-23T19:38:02.135Z",
    "values": [{ "dataPointId": "DP-Temperature", "qualityCode": "0", "value": "10" },
    { "dataPointId": "DP-Pressure", "qualityCode": "0", "value": "10" }]
}];

await retry(5, () => agent.BulkPostData(bulk));

```

The data in the MindSphere can be observed in the fleet manager.

## Proxy support

Set the http_proxy or HTTP_PROXY environment variable if you need to connect via proxy.

```bash
# set http proxy environment variable if you are using e.g. fiddler on the localhost.

export HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:8888
```

## MindSphere TypeScript SDK

The library comes with the typescript SDK which can be used to access MindSphere APIs

[![SDK](https://img.shields.io/badge/SDK-full%20documentation-%23009999.svg)](https://opensource.mindsphere.io/docs/mindconnect-nodejs/sdk/index.html)

It implements support for both frontend (browser e.g. angular, react...) and backend development in node.js. and different MindSphere authentication types:

**Frontend:**
    - Browser (Session, Cookies)

**Backend (node.js):**
    - UserCredentials
    - AppCredentials
    - ServiceCredentials
    - MindSphere Agents

and Clients for following APIs

- AgentManagementClient
- AssetManagementClient
- EventManagementClient
- DataLakeClient
- EventAnalyticsClient
- IotFileClient
- IdentityManagementClient
- KPICalculationClient
- MindConnectAPIClient
- SignalValidationClient
- SpectumAnalysisClient
- TimeSeriesAggregateClient
- TimeSeriesBulkClient
- TimeSeriesClient
- TrendPredictionClient

The example below shows how to use the sdk.

``` typescript
// The example shows how to  Get Assets from MindSphere with custom AssetType using frontend authentication
// you can pass an instance an Authorizer (BrowserAuth, UserAuth, CredentialsAuth, TokenManagerAuth, MindConnectAgent)
// to use different authorization types in MindSphere or implement the TokenRotation interface if you want to
// provide your own authorizer.
//
// The default constructor uses frontend authorization.

const sdk = new MindSphereSdk ();
const am = sdk.GetAssetManagementClient();

const assets = await am.GetAssets({
        filter: JSON.stringify({
            typeId: {
                startsWith: `${tenant}`,
            },
        }),
    });

// you will get fully typed assets in response
```

If an API is missing and you would like to contribute a Client for it take a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Command Line Interface

The full documentation for the command line interface can be found at

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/cli-full%20documentation-%23009999.svg)](https://opensource.mindsphere.io/docs/mindconnect-nodejs/cli/index.html)

The library comes with a command line interface which can also be installed globally. You can use the command line mode to upload timeseries, files and create events in the MindSphere.

```bash
# install the library globaly if you want to use its command line interface.
 npm install -g @mindconnect/mindconnect-nodejs
```

### Binary Releases

The library can also be downloaded as executable from the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/mindsphere/mindconnect-nodejs/releases).

Download the version for your system and place it in folder which is in your PATH.

- `mc.exe` for windows
- `mc-macos` for macOS
- `mc-linux` for Linux

Linux, macOS: Rename the file to `mc` and make sure that the file is marked as executable (`chmod +x`).

### Configuring CLI

First step is to configure the CLI. For this you will need a session cookie from MindSphere, service credentials (which have been deprecated) or application credentials from your developer cockpit.

- [SESSION and XSRF-TOKEN cookie](https://developer.mindsphere.io/howto/howto-local-development.html#generate-user-credentials)
- [Application Credentials](https://documentation.mindsphere.io/resources/html/developer-cockpit/en-US/124342231819.html)
- [Service Credentials](https://developer.mindsphere.io/howto/howto-selfhosted-api-access.html#creating-service-credentials)

First start the credentials configuration. This will start a web server on your local computer where you can enter the credentials.

```bash
# run mc service-credentials --help for full information

$ mc service-credentials
navigate to http://localhost:4994 to configure the CLI
press CTRL + C to exit

```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4994](http://localhost:4994) to configure the CLI. (see [full documentation](https://opensource.mindsphere.io/docs/mindconnect-nodejs/cli/index.html) for XSRF-TOKEN and SESSION)

The image below shows the dialog for adding new credentials (press on the + sign in the upper left corner)

![CLI](images/servicecredentials.png)

You can get the application credentials from your developer or operator cockpit in MindSphere. (if you don't have any application you can register a dummy one just for CLI)

![CLI](images/cockpit.png)

Once configured you can press CTRL + C to stop the configuration server and start using the CLI. Remember the passkey you have created as you will be using it with almost all CLI commands.

### Using CLI

The CLI can be used to create starter projects, upload timeseries, events and files, read agent diagnostics etc.
The CLI commands should only be used **in secure environments!** (e.g on your working station, not on the agents).

### MindSphere Development Proxy

The CLI comes with a development proxy which can be used to kickstart your MindSphere development. It provides an endpoint
at your local machine at

[http://localhost:7707](http://localhost:7707)

which will authenticate all requests using either [a borrowed SESSION and XSRF-TOKEN cookie from MindSphere](https://developer.mindsphere.io/howto/howto-local-development.html#generate-user-credentials) or the the configured app credentials or service credentials.

The command below will start your development proxy without any installation and configuration (you just need the cookies from an existing app):

```bash
npx @mindconnect/mindconnect-nodejs dev-proxy --session <SESSION-TOKEN> --xsrftoken <XSRF-TOKEN> --host <appname>.<tenant>.<region>.mindsphere.io
```

For more complex tasks install and configure the CLI

```text
Usage: mc dev-proxy|px [options]

starts mindsphere development proxy (optional passkey) *

Options:
  -m, --mode [credentials|session]  service/app credentials authentication of
                                    session authentication (default: "session")
  -o, --port <port>                 port for web server (default: "7707")
  -r, --norewrite                   don't rewrite hal+json urls
  -w, --nowarn                      don't warn for missing headers
  -d, --dontkeepalive               don't keep the session alive
  -v, --verbose                     verbose output
  -s, --session <session>           borrowed SESSION cookie from brower
  -x, --xsrftoken <xsrftoken>       borrowed XSRF-TOKEN cookie from browser
  -h, --host <host>                 the address where SESSION and XSRF-TOKEN
                                    have been borrowed from
  -t, --timeout <timeout>           keep alive timeout in seconds (default:
                                    "60")
  -k, --passkey <passkey>           passkey
  --help                            display help for command
