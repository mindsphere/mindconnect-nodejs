 * The KPI Calculation Service computes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for an asset. It uses data sources such as sensors, control units and calendars.

 * Evaluation of characteristics, such as reliability, availability, and maintainability
 * Condition-based maintenance
 * Diagnostics applications and root-cause analysis
 * Risk assessment
